	"description": "It's a race toward the finish line as your favorite characters from Popeye, the animated series, do everything they can to reach the spinach. Now you can play as Popeye, Olive Oyl, Bluto, or Wimpy, as well as compete in either single- or multiplayer races. How soon you arrive at the finish line depends on how fast you can drive a car, grind rails on a skateboard, swing from a vine, fly with a jetpack, and more.",
