Hot Wheels Velocity X tests your driving skills in dangerous missions spanning five destructible levels. You must do whatever it takes to complete the missions--speed through loops, pull off wild stunts, catch big air off a jump, drive up walls and buildings, find hidden shortcuts, or simply just run your opponents off the road.",
