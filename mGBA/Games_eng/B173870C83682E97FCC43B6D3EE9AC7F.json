	"description": "Start your engine. Feel the perfectly-timed motor purr as you roll your rally race car up to the starting line. Ahead of you stretches ribbon of road packed with tight turns and mountainous bumps. And somewhere in the distance are eight rival drivers, jealously clinging to their early leads. But you know that there isn't a car or a racer in the world that can stop you. Whether you're racing on gritty desert roads or slick city streets, you're going to win it all. You have a date with destiny--a gut wrenching, wild ride to the spotlight in the winner's circle.",
