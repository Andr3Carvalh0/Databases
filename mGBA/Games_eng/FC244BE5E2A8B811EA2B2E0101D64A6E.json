Now you can play as any of six characters from your favorite cartoons, including Johnny Bravo; Courage the Cowardly Dog; Cow and Chicken; and Ed, Edd n Eddy. As you move your pieces across four colorful boards, you'll enter a variety of minigames that reward players with money. The cash you earn can help pay for a competitive advantage or access passes to other areas of the board.",
