	"description": "Hop on your bike for a free-wheeling ride up the avenues of not-so-typical suburbia. There are papers to be delivered, robbers to be foiled, and fame and fortune to be won as you brave the mean streets. Avoid traffic, tires, motorcycles, tricycles, gratings, curbs, dogs, dangers and exhaustion as you deliver to your customers - and as you do as much damage as you can to your obstacles. All of the excitement you loved in the arcades, now portable!",
