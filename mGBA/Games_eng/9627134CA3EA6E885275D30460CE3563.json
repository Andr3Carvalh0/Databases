	"description": "How fast can you put together a burger when there are toppings out to get you at every turn? Give Chef Peter Pepper a helping hand to create the ultimate hamburger. Each ingredient is located on a different platform, and you must climb a series of ladders in order to reach them all. Walk across the ingredient to drop it closer to the waiting plate below. Once all the burgers have been completed, you'll be able to move on to the next level. But watch out: Renegade ingredients will stop at nothing to put an end to your cooking days. Dodge them, stun them using pepper or drop a hamburger ingredient on top of them to stop their chase. If you run out of pepper, collect bonus foods such as coffee, chocolate and fries to recharge. It's a nonstop food fight in this classic arcade game.This game is only playable in 2D.",
