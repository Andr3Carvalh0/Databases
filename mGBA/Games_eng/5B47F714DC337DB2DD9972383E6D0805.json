	"description": "This is pure insanity. And to take the checkered flag, you'll need sheer intensity to throttle past hundreds of obstacles, including the Head Spinning Loop and the Sky Riding Ramp. You'll also need precision skills to refuel with Nitro Turbo Boosts that'll power you to victory! There are 8 championship tracks and 3 ultra-challenging levels (Rookie, World Class and Daredevil) to choose from. You can even race against the clock or computer. Or attach your Video Link and spit some mud in the face of a friend. So get down and dirty in an off-road rad race where speed and courage are the difference between popping wheelies and biting the dust.",
