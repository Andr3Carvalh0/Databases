	"description": "BOXXLE is a game. BOXXLE is a puzzle. BOXXLE is the go-anywhere brain teaser for the Game Boy system that you just can't put down. The game is based on moving crates around in a warehouse. But manual labor won't win the game: it takes brain power to move boxes into their proper spaces to clean up the room and get to the next screen... and the next... and the next! The puzzles keep coming - over 100 different screens in all. It BOXXLES the mind! Plus, you can pick your puzzle or use the edit function to create your own screens. You'll never get bored once you get BOXXLE!",
