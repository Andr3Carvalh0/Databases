Complete the entire pyramid, and Q*bert moves to a more challenging pyramid. But look out! The crafty arcade creatures are here, too, and they're after Q*bert. Hop out of danger fast - or soar to safety on a flying disc. But watch where you move Q*bert. One hop off the pyramid and he'll be lost in space!",
