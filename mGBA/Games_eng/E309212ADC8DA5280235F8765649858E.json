To complicate things, Hamsterviel created evil alien Experiments that go head-to-head with our heroes. Start by capturing each Experiment and harnessing its special power in order to progress and capture the next. Sparky, Experiment 22, helps you out with his powerful electricity balls, while Richter, Experiment 513, shakes things up by igniting an earthquake.
