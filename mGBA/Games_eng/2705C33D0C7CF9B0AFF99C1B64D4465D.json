Since many viruses are trapped at the bottom of the bottle, you must plan ahead in order to eliminate them.In Puzzle League, you'll form a chain of three or more same-colored blocks. When you match up shapes, the blocks on top will fall onto other matching blocks, but if you can't make a match, the blocks rise to the top of the screen. This game also has unusual depth in terms of options and settings which lets players create a custom game experience.",
