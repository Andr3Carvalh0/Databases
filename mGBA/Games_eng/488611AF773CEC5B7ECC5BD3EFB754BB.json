	"description": "Silicon Valley was intended to be the most technologically advanced amusement park civilization has ever known. Shortly after take-off, it disappeared. Now, in the year 3000, it's back and on a collision course with Earth! It's up to you to conquer the 30 levels in four incredibly lavish environments, take control of the totally original, wacky and - at times - life threatening characters and unlock the mysteries of the Valley. It's all great fun but remember, the fate of the world is in your hands!",
