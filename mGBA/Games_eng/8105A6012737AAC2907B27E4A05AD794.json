For the first time, you'll be able to save your high scores and progress as you rocket through the seven gravity-defying stages that started it all. After you outrun Dr. Robotnik and his badniks in Original Mode, race through the famous loop-de-loops even faster with Sonic's trademark Spin Dash in Anniversary Mode which celebrates Sonic's 15th birthday.",
