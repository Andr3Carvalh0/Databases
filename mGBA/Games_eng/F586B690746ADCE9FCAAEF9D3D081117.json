	"description": "Comix Zone is a 1995 arcade-style action game. The game's most remarkable feature is that it is set within the 'panels' of a comic book. Each level consists of two 'pages' and secrets are discovered by shredding the 'paper' and revealing items. The unique dialogue is rendered within talk bubbles with the typical comic font. Sprites and backgrounds possess the bright colors and dynamic drawing style favored by superhero comics.",
