	"description": "In Crash of the Titans, players fight a nefarious plot hatched by Crash's arch nemeses Neo and Nina Cortex to mutate the local creatures into titanic abominations. Using Crash's legendary mix of outrageous antics and daredevil bravado, players 'hijack' enemies to take control of their action and use their fearsome powers against all manner of enemies. 'Jack to Attack!' &ndash; Control, play and battle as 15 enemies, including titanic creatures such as Scorporilla, Ratcicle, Magamadon and Shellephant. While in control of a monster players can throw toxic stink bombs, call lightning down from the sky, fire lasers beams from their eyes or even impale enemies with a massive scorpion tail - use all of the creatures' special abilities to defeat Neo and Nina Cortex. Crash now has a powerful acrobatic fighting system that includes punches and flying kicks, multiple attacks and special counter moves. Players can power-up skills to unlock new attacks and blazing combos. Crash can now interact with his world in totally new ways. Players can wall-run, swing from ropes and flip off springboards &ndash; Crash can even toss Aku Aku on the ground to surf, skate, grind and shred. At any point in the game, a second player can join in the fun and play as Carbon-Crash to help unleash total chaos. In a totally innovative twist to co-op action gaming, Crash can even jack Carbon-Crash (or vice versa) for some hysterical Crash 'jacked'-Crash mayhem.",
