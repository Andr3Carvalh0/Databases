We'll scare our way through eight horrific levels, including the Graveyard (it's so nice this time of the year) and the Ghoul House. And run into (and away from) Killer Giant Beetles, Legs Without Heads and Deadly Scorpions. Wait 'til you get a load of the weirdos in the Afterlife Waiting Room! Just remember, one wrong move and you're food for the Sand Worm.",
