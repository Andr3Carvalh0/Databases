New player motion captures, new player models and dynamics and stadium environments will deliver true-to-life representations of player tactics as each game is played in real-time, while enhanced post-match statistics will give an at-a-glance guide to how well those tactics worked. All these innovative features have been topped off with unique game content input and an in-game end of season evaluation as a Player Manager from Ferguson himself.",
