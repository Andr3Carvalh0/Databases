	"description": "What's more fun than watching cartoons? Actually starring in one! Each level features a different character starring in its own 'mini-cartoon', with plots, obstacles, traps and surprises designed especially for each one. You'll actually become Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, the Tasmanian Devil, Road Runner and more as you race to save the world against some very familiar enemies, and a few new diabolical menaces you may never forget! You'll have to master each character's special talents to cross deserts, swim the deepest oceans, fly through the air and creep your way through a haunted mansion filled with totally gruesome ghosts and goblins! There's only one way to describe this awesome action: Totally looney!",
