	"description": "Team up with a cast of crazy critters, unleashing your animal instincts in Open Season, the game - a riotous romp in the great outdoors in which a rowdy brood of forest animals turns the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters. When a domesticated grizzly named Boog gets lured into leaving the creature comforts of home by a fast-talking mule deer named Elliott, he finds himself lost in the woods just three days before hunting season begins. Forced to 'rough it' in the great outdoors, Boog goes native, rallying all the forest animals to take back their home and send the hunters packing. Interact with Beth, Shaw, and all your animal favorites from the Open Season film. Throw skunk bombs, hurl rabbits, use acorn-firing squirrels, and pull outrageous woodland pranks to scare the pants off the hunters. Roll in a giant snowball, ride the rapids on a floating outhouse, zip through tunnels in a crazy mine cart ride, and take on more madcap adventures as Boog discovers how to go from 'Mild' to 'Wild'. Challenge your friends or team up together in 4-player mini-games.",
