	"description": "It's a New Word Order in video games as those Soviet Blocks fall again! Letter by letter, words fall together at your command. Horizontally. Vertically. Quickly. They clear. You score. The pace quickens. So does your mind - creating words you didn't even know existed! You await a letter for that Magic Word. (The one that scores big, then wipes the slate clean.) Suddenly, a Wild Card Block appears. You flip through the alphabet, drop that critical letter into place, and Ahhhh. You breathe again. And you are hooked - to the letter!",
