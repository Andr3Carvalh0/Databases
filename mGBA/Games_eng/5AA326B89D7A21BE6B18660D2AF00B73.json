	"description": "Now you can find out what made Pac-Man an icon of the 1980s and an icon of video game culture. In this NES Classics game, Pac-Man gets to do what he does best: chomp pellets and ghosts. You'll maneuver Pac-Man through a maze filled with pellets, fruit, power pellets, and ghosts. Your enemies--Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Inky--aren't very smart, but they move faster as the game progresses. Two players can take turns mastering the maze, either on the same Game Pak or through the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable.",
